I'm not going yo make it
Is it almost over now?
Can't open up my eyes
I can't understand
How this chain reaction
Could bring me to the edge
I'm looking down
One more step
Could have made me free
I could fall into the darkness
Realize that I am just so afraid
I don't want to destroy life
Remember?
I know you want to
It's alright
Remember
I'm not going to make it
Is it almost over now?
Can't see the way to go
I feel so alone
My body is on the ground
This time I lost control
I gave up my thoughts
Heard my inner voices
Until they all renounce me in the end
Be true to yourself
I've heard enough of that
I know if I remember
I'll find the good but I don't care
I don't want to destroy life
Remember?
I know you want to
It's alright
Remember
I still believe
I still believe in myself
I still believe...
I'm not going to make it
Is it almost over now?
Can't see the way to go
I feel so alone
My blood is on the ground
I can't forgive this anymore
One last chance to make it
If it's almost over now
Can't see the way to go
I feel so alone
My blood is on the ground
I can't forgive this anymore
Who chooses what is right?
No one can really tell
So will you turn around
Or will you fade away?
My heart is crying out
I may never see
But still I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
